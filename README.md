# Formalization Seminar SoSe 2025 Uni Greifswald

This the course webpage for a seminar on formalization in Lean at the Universit√§t Greifswald in summer semester 2025. The goal is to learn something about formalization of mathematics and how to use the proof assistant Lean.

## Some Theoretical Background

Here are some sources about the underlying theoretical aspects:

 - [Spartan Type Theory](https://math.andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Spartan-Type-Theory.pdf) by [Andrej Bauer](https://www.andrej.com/)
 - [An Introduction to Univalent Foundations for Mathematicians](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2018-55-04/S0273-0979-2018-01616-9/S0273-0979-2018-01616-9.pdf) (the first 5 sections) by Dan Grayson
 - [Naive Type Theory](https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/psztxa/publ/fomus19.pdf) by [Thorsten Altenkirch](https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/psztxa/)
 - [Type Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
 - [Introduction to Type Theory](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/PUBS/IntroTT-improved.pdf) by [Herman Geuvers](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/)

 Here are some sources about various proof assistants: 
 - [Proof Assistants: history, ideas and future](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/PUBS/proofassistants.pdf) by [Herman Geuvers](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/)
 - [The Seventeen Provers of the World](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/comparison/comparison.pdf) by [Freek Wiedijk](https://www.cs.ru.nl/staff/Freek.Wiedijk/)

## Some First Steps before the First Steps

Before starting with installations on your computer, here are some first games one can try online (not required):

- [The Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4)
- [The Set Theory Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/djvelleman/stg4)

## Setting Lean Up on your Computer

Participation in the Seminar requires local installations. These steps should help:

- Follow the following [instructions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) 
- **Note:** Part of the installation involves installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (where we write Lean code) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)
- **Warning:** if you are using Windows you might have to deactivate your anti-virus during the installation process!

## Setting Up this Project on your Computer

As part of this course you need to set up this project on your own computer:

- Make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- Fork this repository to your own account.
- Clone the repository to your local computer so that you can start working with it. 

## Setting Things Up Online

If there are any challenges with the local installation, here are some (temporary) online solutions:

- There is an online option for experimentation with Lean: [Lean Online](https://live.lean-lang.org/)
- A more advanced option is to work with the project via GitHub Codespaces:

- Another option to work with the project is via Gitpod:

## Learning Material

Here are is some interesting learning material:
- [Glimpse of Lean](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/GlimpseOfLean) by [Patrick Massot](https://github.com/PatrickMassot)
- [The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/) by [Heather Macbeth](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/)
- [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) by [Jeremy Avigad](https://github.com/avigad) and [Patrick Massot](https://github.com/PatrickMassot) 
- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/) by [Jeremy Avigad](https://github.com/avigad), [Leonardo de Moura](https://leodemoura.github.io/), [Soonho Kong](https://github.com/soonhokong) and [Sebastian Ullrich](https://github.com/kha)

## Some Other Recommendations

- You should make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- There is a [Zulip channel](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) that has a lot of useful information.
